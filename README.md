## Module 6 - ServerSide API's Challenge
### This week I was tasked to create a weather dashboard where users could search for a city and see the current weather condtions along with the conditions for the next five days.
## Site functionality 
### When a user enters a city they are presented with the current and five day forecast. The city they enter is also displayed in a recent cities list, where from they can select that city and see the weather conditions. They can also change the units to imperial or metric.
